Lab: Linux xargs command

Commands:
xargs
| pipe first command into second ~/project/file_archive.txt
The -n option of xargs allows us to limit the number of arguments passed to each command execution
-I {} tells xargs to replace occurrences of {} in the command with each input line

Key Takeaway:
Learned how to use the xargs command to automate file management tasks.

Difficulty:
Easy

Real Use Case:
Organising archives/databases, for example, making folders for each each line of text in a file

Lab: First python lab

Commands:
python (launch the interpreter)
*can also use as a calculator so for example, 3 + 2 or (7 * 4) + (20 / 5)
x = 100, y = 6 (variables)
name = "John" 
print() , eg: name = "Alice"
print("My name is", name)
input()
exit()

Key Takeaway:
Ability to easily launch and regain familiarity with python. Understanding what variables and strings are.

Difficulty:
Easy to follow

Real Use Case:
- Launch the Python interpreter
- Work with variables and assignments
- Use the print() function to display output
- Interact with users using the input() function
- Properly exit the Python interpreter

Lab: Python Data Types and Operators

Commands:
books = 5
print(f"I have {books} books.")
type(books)
boolean = is_learning = True
is_finished = False
print(f"Are we learning Python? {is_learning}")
type(is_learning)

Key Takeaway:
Learned about the fundamental building blocks of Python:

Difficulty:
Lots of new information to organise and make sense of and actively recall when needed.

Real Use Case:
- Numeric Types: You worked with integers (int) for whole numbers and floats (float) for decimal numbers.
- Strings (str): You learned how to create and manipulate text.
- Booleans (bool): You explored True and False values and used them for comparisons.
- Operators: You used arithmetic (*), comparison (==, <), and boolean (and, or) operators.
- Type Conversion: You practiced converting between different data types, like turning a string into a number.
